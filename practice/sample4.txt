STOPPING AT A FRIEND'S FARM-HOUSE
AUTHOR:MENG HAORAN

PREPARING ME CHICKEN AND RICE, OLD FRIEND, 
YOU ENTERTAIN ME AT YOUR FARM. 
WE WATCH THE GREEN TREES THAT CIRCLE YOUR VILLAGE 
AND THE PALE BLUE OF OUTLYING MOUNTAINS. 
WE OPEN YOUR WINDOW OVER GARDEN AND FIELD, 
TO TALK MULBERRY AND HEMP WITH OUR CUPS IN OUR HANDS. 
...WAIT TILL THE MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY -- 
I AM COMING AGAIN IN CHRYSANTHEMUM TIME.
